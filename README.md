### Hi there 💭

I'm always seeking for having new ideas and developing solutions that make a social impact.😁

Since I was little, I have been in contact with systems and technology because of my father, but my first line of code was made in a robotics competition at my school, in the same place where later I understand how technology can transform the lives of underprivileged people, if used correctly.🌳

I am currently a Frontend Developer at Infosys, working on the planning, development and maintenance of new features in Braskem's management platform, together with an incredible team.💻
