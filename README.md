### Hi there ðŸ’­

Hey, how are you? I'm Matheus Santos, I'm Frontend Developer for over 2 years. Passionate about web development, design and open source projects. I'm always looking for new challenges, to learn and develop myself more. Out of work, I develop my own projects, in addition to playing games, listening to music and thinking about the worldðŸ˜œ.
