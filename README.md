### Hi there 💭

I'm Matheus Santos, I'm 17 years old and my first contact with programming was through my robotics team. At there I realized that we can change the world through technology and, because of that, nowadays I create solutions with the objective of improving and facilitating people's lives, besides creating opportunities through it! I consider myself a front end developer, designer and technology enthusiast, always following my values and with the intention of learning new things.
